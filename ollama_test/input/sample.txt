    GraphRAG is a powerful tool for analyzing text data using graph-based methods.
    It combines large language models with graph algorithms to extract insights from documents.

    Microsoft developed GraphRAG to help researchers and analysts understand complex datasets.
    The system can identify entities, relationships, and communities within text corpora.

    Key features include:
    - Entity extraction from unstructured text
    - Relationship identification between entities
    - Community detection in knowledge graphs
    - Global and local search capabilities

    GraphRAG supports various LLM providers including OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and local models via Ollama.
    This makes it flexible for different deployment scenarios and cost considerations.
